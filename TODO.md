## Aphids

 * Calculate u(d^*) and u(d_orig)
 * Figure a: real data and observation
 * Figure b: n(t) + d^* and prior predictive
 * Figure c: c(t) + d^* and prior predictive 
 
## PK model

  * Calculate u(d^*) and u(d_dr)
  * Figure a:
    - simulations from prior predictive - same number as aphids
    - Show dro & our design points
  * Figure b: 
    - Zoomed in version

## SD

  * Calculate SD and do crude t.test of top n
